## General Knowledge Answers

1. The Sun is a massive ball of hot gases (mainly hydrogen and helium) and its true color is white.

2. The true color of water is light blue, although it often appears colorless in small quantities.

3. There are 6 basic human emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. Some models include up to 27.

4. 100Â°C is the boiling point of water in Celsius at sea level.

5. Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity.
